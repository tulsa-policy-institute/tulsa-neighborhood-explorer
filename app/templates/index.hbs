      The Tulsa Neighborhood Explorer is an implementation of the Neighborhood Health Assessment used to inform residents of the overall “health” of their neighborhoods by utilizing data analysis and identifying how specific indicators are performing in comparison with the remaining parts of the city.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      Neighborhood health is determined based on conditions of both built environment and socioeconomic factors. Various data points can assess such conditions.
